This application implements an online store, with a catalog, cart and orders.

It is divided into two main sections:

The buyer's side of the application manages the catalog, cart and checkout. Its implementation spans in four models and associated controllers and views: Cart, LineItem, Order and Product. Additionally, there is a StoreController for the store front itself and a SessionController to manage sessions.

Only administrators can access stuff in the seller's side(product maintainenece and order fulfilment). This is implemened by the LoginController, is enforced by the ApplicationController#authorize method, and assisted by the Users and Carts resources.
